- `HEADER`: Logout clicks
- `CLIENTS`: Fetch operations
- `TEAM`: Fetch operations  
- `FILE_MANAGER`: Upload, add link, fetch files

### Debug Tools
- Global click tracker (logs every click with context)
- Error boundary (catches crashes with friendly UI)
- Debug console UI (floating 🐛 button, expandable panel)

## Action Required

### 1. Replace Settings Page

cd /workspaces/video-production-app
mv app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx.backup
mv app/dashboard/settings-new.tsx app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx
```

### 2. Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Settings Page
- Go to Settings
- Update profile information
- Update company info (if admin/PM)
- Change password
- Check debug console for logs

### 4. Verify No Errors
```bash
# Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for hardcoded test emails
grep -r "user@example.com" app/
# Should only find placeholders in input fields
```

## Summary of Changes
